## Projects

### 1. Car Price Prediction
- **Files:** `CarPrice_Assignment.py`, `CarPrice_Assignment.csv`
- **Description:** Predicts car prices using **Linear Regression** based on various car features.
- **Libraries Used:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn
- **Tasks Performed:**
  - Data preprocessing and encoding categorical variables
  - Splitting data into training and testing sets
  - Training a Linear Regression model
  - Evaluating the model using **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **R² Score**
  - Visualizing **actual vs predicted car prices**
